## Configuring Development Environment

To configure Quartz to your specified needs... A gulpfile has been provided with some basic setup options.
It has a setting to compile sass to expanded CSS, or sass to compressed CSS, watch for sass save and compile to compressed and expanded CSS.
    ```bash
        # Compile to expanded CSS
        gulp sass-expanded

        # Compile to compressed CSS
        gulp sass-compressed

        # Setup watchman and compile both expanded and compressed CSS
        gulp sass:watch
    ```
